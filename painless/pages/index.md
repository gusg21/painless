# painless
A feather-weight static site generator like [hyde](http://hyde.github.io/) written in Python

*************************

painless is a static site generator that feels a lot like [hyde](http://hyde.github.io/), except less sophisticated and pretty easy to use (in my opinion).

## Getting started

### Downloading

To get set up, clone the repo to your site's directory like so:

    git clone http://github.com/gusg21/painless/ super-cool-site

Or you can click the [download](http://github.com/gusg21/painless) button and rename the downloaded folder. Your choice.
